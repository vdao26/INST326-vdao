Week 1
This week, I used AI to explain to me how to make my github 
respository public, so that the TAs can access my journals and other
assignments on GitHub. I used specifically Gemini to help me. Gemini 
told me to go to Github.com, click on my respository, go to settings, and 
scroll all the way at the bottom where it says "danger zone", and change
visibility to public.

Other than that, I have not used AI in this class as I am 
trying to review Python by myself because I have some experience with it.
I want to test my memory of what I learned in other Python classes 
and INST126.

Week 2
This week, I used AI to reinforce my knowledge of for loops and if/else statements.
I am familiar with both but I struggle to understand for loops more. Here is the link to what I asked
Claude AI. I do not use while loops often so I also wanted to see what was the difference between a for loop and while 
loop. https://claude.ai/share/ced870ee-a7b5-49be-9e3c-1f56beed6b95

While I was working on Week 2 exercises, I found myself using while loops and it helped me practice what I learned from Claude.
As in for for loops, I think it depends on what the prompt is asking. Sometimes it can be a bit confusing but once I disect the prompt
I know how the for loop work.


Week 3
This week we learned about writing functions, which I have prior knowledge because I took INST126 last year, but I was still a little confused about the return statement and where to write it in the function. I used Claude.AI to help explain what the return statement does https://claude.ai/share/49ad0101-5258-4450-adb8-c431f218d089 

I learned that return statements can have multiple of them in a function but only one executes each time the function is called. Something I knew from INST126 is that the return statement should be at the end of the function.
