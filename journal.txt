Week 1
This week, I used AI to explain to me how to make my github 
respository public, so that the TAs can access my journals and other
assignments on GitHub. I used specifically Gemini to help me. Gemini 
told me to go to Github.com, click on my respository, go to settings, and 
scroll all the way at the bottom where it says "danger zone", and change
visibility to public.

Other than that, I have not used AI in this class as I am 
trying to review Python by myself because I have some experience with it.
I want to test my memory of what I learned in other Python classes 
and INST126.

Week 2
This week, I used AI to reinforce my knowledge of for loops and if/else statements.
I am familiar with both but I struggle to understand for loops more. Here is the link to what I asked
Claude AI. I do not use while loops often so I also wanted to see what was the difference between a for loop and while 
loop. https://claude.ai/share/ced870ee-a7b5-49be-9e3c-1f56beed6b95

While I was working on Week 2 exercises, I found myself using while loops and it helped me practice what I learned from Claude.
As in for for loops, I think it depends on what the prompt is asking. Sometimes it can be a bit confusing but once I disect the prompt
I know how the for loop work.


Week 3
This week we learned about writing functions, which I have prior knowledge because I took INST126 last year, 
but I was still a little confused about the return statement and where to write it in the function. I
used Claude.AI to help explain what the return statement does https://claude.ai/share/49ad0101-5258-4450-adb8-c431f218d089 

I learned that return statements can have multiple of them in a function but only one executes each time the function is called. 
Something I knew from INST126 is that the return statement should be at the end of the function. 

Week 4
This week we started our unit on Classes and writing them including attributes and methods for it. 
While I was working on Week 4 excerises, I saw that some of the __init__ method had instance variables that
were not stated in the parameters. I went to ask Claude.AI about this https://claude.ai/share/13f3c9f4-1bb8-46c2-830b-e5963f7b8c38

According to Claude, there are several reasons why these attributes might not be in the parameters. 
The attributes could be calculated from the input parameters. Claude gave an example of calculating area. 
Because width and height are the input parameters, when we are assigning area, it does not need to be 
in the parameters because we do not need input from the user. 

It is derived from the parameters. Claude also stated attributes with the same value for every instance. 
For example, count would be in the parameter because it will always start at 0.

__init__ parameters should be what the user needs to provide.

Week 5
This week, I learned about protected and private attributes in the __init__ method. Before INST327, I had not used protected or private attributes or knew how to use them. To get a sense of them and how to use them in this week's exercise, I asked Claude.AI what are the differences between the two 
https://claude.ai/share/39aba95e-946b-4e73-bbd1-48d3cf4ec5d5 Protected attributes use a single _ and is intended for internal use within the class. Private attributes use the double __ and is used to prevent accidental name collisions in inheritance hierarchies.

In Python, we use getters and setters to get an attribute value and set it. I asked Claude to explain to me how to use them https://claude.ai/share/39aba95e-946b-4e73-bbd1-48d3cf4ec5d5. I learned that the getter for Python is @property. We usually use getters and setters for private/protected attributes with encapsulation and make sure we validate our values. 

Week 6
This week's topic covered classes in python and different methods such as static, class, and instance. I had previously worked with classes in Java, but did not really understand the full concept. I used Claude.AI to help me explain the differences between static and class methods https://claude.ai/share/2cd52e37-998a-4bed-a132-15d5feaf86c9 These are special types of methods that belong to the class itself and not the instance of the class. Class methods are defined as @classmethod
and use the cls parameter instead of self. 

Static methods are also defined as @staticmethod and don't receive any implicit first argument (no self or cls). Some uses for static methods are
utility functions that don't need to access class or instance data. Some differences with static and class methods:
-Class methods receive the class as the first argument and can access/modify class state
-Static methods don't receive any implicit arguments and can't access class or instance state directly

Week 7
This week's topic covered error handling and testing in Python. One testing framework I learned was unittest. To understand unittest further, I used Claude AI to explain to me https://claude.ai/share/980480c2-fd53-4df0-a699-64c05a3467fb 

Unittest is a built-in Python test that helps you write and run automated tests for the program. There is a test case, which you create a class and each test method should start with test_. In these test methods, you need to use assertions like assertEqual or assertTrue. At the end, you will run the test using main().   

Week 8
This week's topic covered inheritance. I have learned about this concept in Java, but I needed to refresh my memory. I used Claude.AI
to remind me how inheritance works https://claude.ai/share/84e76924-4b50-4719-a6b6-775bd9d29b52
Inheritance is an OOP concept that lets a class (child) inherits attributes and methods from another class (parent). This helps with code reusability and a hierarchial relationship between classes. The super() function allows you to call methods from the parent class and useful in the __init__ method. 

Week 9
This week we learned about polymorphism and abstract classes. I am not too familiar with working on these concepts so I used Claude
AI explain this week's exercises and how abstract classes work. Abstract classes are instantlated direct and designed to be inherited by other classes. 
It is like a blueprint or template to define a common goal for a group of related classes. In Python, we use ABC (abstract base class) module to implement these classes. 
Before every abstract method, you need to put @abstractmethod. Methods that are marked with @abstractmethod must be implemented by subclasses.
For example, we have our abstract class Animal. Its subclasses would be Dog and Cat. https://claude.ai/share/d05de0c4-c094-471a-80b6-1348e8de3334

Week 10
This week we looked more closely into special methods such as (__str__, __repr__, __len__, __iter__, __contains__, __eq__, ordering). I am not familiar with these methods because I do not use them often. https://claude.ai/share/431b485e-d7d5-4705-a1ab-d0260f17e9b5

These methods help us define how objects in our classes behave with built-in Python operations. 
__str__ - String representation: human readable string, easy for users to read
__repr__ - String representation for developers: used for debugging and is ambiguous
__len__ - Length of Object: uses len() and returns the length of an object
__iter__ - Make objects iterable: returns an iterator object, allows objects to be used in loops
__contains__ - membership testing: defines behaviors for the in operator
__eq__ - equality comparison: defines behavior for the equality operator ==
ordering methods define behaviors for comparison operators.

Special methods help make our classes easy for us to debug and follow through. They follow Python conventions and works well with built-in Python functions.

Week 12
This week we are learning about testing and system architecture. I was wondering the differences between unit, system, and integration testing so I asked Claude.AI to explain. https://claude.ai/share/11f8d591-b703-4aa3-b84b-2de1d1eacd85 
Unit testing focuses on a single function, method or class. Integration testing tests how multiple components work together. It also verifies that different modules/classes interact correctly.
System testing tests the complete application flow and validates the entire system from start to finish.

Week 13
This week is the final week of class. Me and my team for the semester project used ChatGPT to outline our presentation and made
sure everything that was required was in the presentation. https://chatgpt.com/share/6939d4c2-4a40-8006-86b8-bcb2c86be939
We used this outline and incorporated it with the python files we have and added more detail into our classes/OOP components in our presentation.
