Week 1
This week, I used AI to explain to me how to make my github 
respository public, so that the TAs can access my journals and other
assignments on GitHub. I used specifically Gemini to help me. Gemini 
told me to go to Github.com, click on my respository, go to settings, and 
scroll all the way at the bottom where it says "danger zone", and change
visibility to public.

Other than that, I have not used AI in this class as I am 
trying to review Python by myself because I have some experience with it.
I want to test my memory of what I learned in other Python classes 
and INST126.
